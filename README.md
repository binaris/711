# 711

A **public** convenience script store.

Try not to rely on Git versioning too much here.

e.g. a good script name would be `ubuntu/install_terraform_0.10.2.sh` and not `install_terraform.sh` (relying on Git versioning to settle the terraform version inside the script).

In other words, only change scripts if you find bugs in them, not to update versions. For new versions, create new scripts.
